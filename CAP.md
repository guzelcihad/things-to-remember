ACID consistency is all about database rules. If a schema declares that a value must be unique, then a consistent system will enforce uniqueness of that value across all operations. If a foreign key implies deleting one row will delete related rows, then a consistent system will ensure the state canâ€™t contain related rows once the base row is deleted.

CAP consistency promises that every replica of the same logical value, spread across nodes in a distributed system, has the same exact value at all times. Note that this is a logical guarantee, rather than a physical one. Due to the speed of light, it may take some non-zero time to replicate values across a cluster. The cluster can still present a logical view by preventing clients from viewing different values at different nodes.
