## Minimize Mutability
Immutable classes are easier to design, implement, and use than mutable classes. They are
less prone to error and are more secure.
<br>
In method we return new objects rather than modify the data.
This pattern is known as the functional approach because methods return
the result of applying a function to their operand, without modifying it.
Contrast it
to the procedural or imperative approach in which methods apply a procedure to
their operand, causing its state to change.
